<h2 style="margin: 0; padding-left: 50px; color: green; background-color: #fffdd0;">The Twelve Pillars</h2>
<p class="overall">Chapters 4 - 7 of Twelve Pillars were really awe-inspiring. It starts by emphasizing how important is it to not only formulate goals but write them down.
   Goals can be long-term (10 years), medium-term (5 years), or short-term (1 year). Something special happens in the brain/mind when it sees tangible things written
   down on paper - it becomes more cognitively aware and sets about to achieve them. This is a much more structured approach to life that, if heeded, could really 
   make me more committed in all aspects of my life, and use my time more productively as I work towards attaining them my goals and dreams.</br></br>

   Becoming successful is not an overnight occurrence but must be initiated by conscious thought to head in a different direction. It requires discipline
   to work hard, and stick to a structured, maybe even boring, routine. Time spent working on the things which are important to me is key, rather than working
   on urgent things for someone else. The fun life may seem to be passing by but this pain is much more tolerable than the pain of regretting that I could have
   done more with my life. Fun times can be enjoyed more by people who are successful rather than those who are struggling - especially financially. Now is the time
   to be the architect of my time.</br></br>

   Another key pillar to becoming successful is by associating with successful people. There is an unwritten universal law that states that the people we surround
   ourselves with will be the greatest influence on our lives. So if we surround ourselves with negative people we naturally will develop a negative outlook on 
   our job, family, and life in general. Therefore, disassociating from bad influences is critical to becoming successful. I have seen firsthand where some people just live
   for the sensual pleasures of this life - drinking, smoking, partying, gambling, sex, among other things. Trying to become better versions of themselves is not even 
   remotely considered by them. These persons often are always in need of some kind assistance, constantly borrowing, and hardly ever repaying their debts. These are the 
   persons I have learnt to have limited association with, or even completely disassociated from. Then there are persons who are ungodly - these I 
   disassociate from almost immediately once I find out who they are.</br></br>

   Increased associaton with highly successful people, on the other hand, has proven beneficial to many because these people will push you to greatness if you want
   to maintain your presence in their sphere, or enjoy the type of lifestyle they do. They have often acquired high levels of expertise in their chosen domain and so a 
   wealth of knowledge can be gleaned from them. They have networks of other influencial people who can really get you ahead in life. This can open up doors in
   areas of employment and insider information, that one would never think possible. One would be compelled to follow their path and reap the rewards. Confidence,
   belief, will, determination, and perseverance would all increase and change who one is on the journey to becoming the best version of oneself.</br>

   On the flip side, there exists many more poor people than there are rich. Many persons have the notion that being poor means the person has failed at life. While
   this may be true in some instances does it mean that the person is negative, evil, or ungodly? Quite the contrary, some of the poorest people I know have the 
   purest hearts, are very loving, humble, and have a will that is unbelievable. They are rich in faith! The faith it takes to trust GOD for their daily meal is
   unsurpassed. These are the people I oftentimes turn to when I need to borrow some faith to get me through a crisis I might be going through. And they are always 
   willing to give it. In fact, I have seen these people give the last they had to people who needed it more than they did. I had a friend named Miss Pam who would
   always ensure I got my bunch of ripe bananas every week, and this was at a time when I could not go to the market myself. Miss Pam didn't have a job but would make herself 
   helpful for the community primary school by doing errands for the teachers, and sweeping and cleaning their classrooms - even though they didn't ask her to. As soon as she got
   $1000, off to the market she went. The Bible says we are to associate and help the poor, lowly, widow, and fatherless, and avoid elitetism: and our reward will be
   rich in heaven. </br></br>

   In the same manner that association with successful people may increase your likelihood of success, reading what successful people write can be just as
   impactful. "Reading maketh a man." Again, something speacial happens to the mind when it reads inpirational things on a page: special synapses are formed, a fire
   is lit. My life changed when I read the Bible. That is why I was so glad when I saw the Bible at the top of the list of books that Charlie gave to Michaeal. However, I was just  little
   disappointed when he didn't give him an actual copy of the Bible to read first. The Bible is, however, the greatest book ever written. It has unparalled
   inspiration on what people can achieve when they trust and believe in GOD. It showcases righteous people - wealthy people and poor alike. It has prophecies which
   have been fulfilled, and prophecies yet to be fulfilled. It seats me at the dinner table of kings, scribes, phophets, priests, and judges.  It is written
   brilliantly in a number of literary styles and expressions. It reveals the origin and destiny of all things. Since I have read it, I know my purpose here on this 
   earth - to live the way GOD intended for me to live and help others come to the knowledge and fulfillment of their purpose also. I have become calmer, bolder,
   more confident, more disciplined, and more driven.</br></br>

   Conversely, some books have been used to brainwash people negatively. I remember being approached by someone who said I looked like the right candidate who wanted to
   be wealthy and finally stop working for others. All I had to do was to read a book from her organization each week before our weekly meetings in the lobby of The 
   Courtyard Marriott. Similarly, this was the same thing Charlie told Michael: he needed to read The Magic of Thinking Big before he would meet with him again. The two books I read
   from this lady were triumphant stories of networking with the wealthy and doing what they said in order to achieve similar results. I was motivated and committed to the task
   after reading those books. However, after one mega conference at the Pegasus auditorium and one at UTech, I fould out that these people were not really loving people. In fact, 
   they were all about the money (my money). They wanted me to spend $50,000 per month to buy their products, another USD200 to sign up, and about $30,000 to buy
   DVDs that I had to listen to every day for about 2 hours. Needless to say, I disassociated from them. The right books can be used to inspire and motivate, and 
   even the wrong books can, but the wrong ones can sell you an unrealistic dream that will open you up to be taken advantage of.
