<h1><center>Personality</center></h1>
<h2>My Strongest Trait</h2>
<p>Determination has always been one of my strongest traits. This trait was further developed by its symbiotic relationship with track and field while in high school - 
   I was determined to train hard and compete well, and this in turn increased my level of determination. I have had to apply the levels of determination and
   sheer will obtained to my University exploits. There are times when the pressure gets so much that it would even make me want to give up but then I dig
   deep like I used to when training or competing, and remember that I am not a quitter.</br>

   This background has also fostered a life fitness and health. When I am in my best shape the rigours of university courses, full-time employment, and being
   a father are that much more manageable. To be at my best I run 3 times at week and compete in 5Km roadraces, and the occasional 10K and half marathon. I have also 
   fallen in love with going to the market regularly, blending juices, and eating from the soil. The fit and healthy version of me can get by with less sleep, 
   and still have higher energy levels to do the things which matter most.  My 6-year-old son keeps me fit nowadays since he is a zealous runner and footballer.</br>

<h2>My Hero</h2>
<p>"...and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish." (King James Version Bible, 2020, Esther 4:16)</br>
   Queen Esther uttered these words as she put her plan into action. Even though she was the wife of King Ahasuerus it was against the law for anyone who the king had
   not summoned to visit the king unannouced. This crime was punishable by death. The queen had recently found out about a plot by the king's right hand man, Haman,
   to deceive the king into killing all the Jews in the territory. Esther was also a Jew but had kept it a secret from everyone, including the king.</br>

   So Queen Esther fasted for 3 days before she would make her potentially deadly trip to see the king. Not only did she fast but she also dressed in her most royal,
   beautiful clothes so that when the king saw her he couldn't resist her beauty. Not only couldn't he resist her but he granted her safe passage in the royal palace, 
   and any favour which she desired. She invited the king and Haman to a royal banquet which she would prepare the next day. They both accepted the invitation. 
   That same night GOD caused the king to read the royal records and discovered that Esther's uncle, Mordecai, a jew, had saved his life some years before. 
   At the banquet the queen revealed the evil plot of Haman to deceive the king into killing all the Jews. The king then commanded that Haman be killed. His commandment
   was swiftly executed and Haman perished.</br>

   This brave action by Queen Esther saved all the Jews, and paved the way for Jesus Christ to come into the world through the bloodline of King David. She was not
   fearful and risked her own life to save her people. She is my hero. </p>

<h2>Reflection on Test Results</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, the test results were amazingly accurate. The summary that was given of my personality was spot on. It gives the same positive
   perspective I have of myself. This summary of me prooves it's validity not only with me but would, by extension, make
   it a valid test in general.</p>
